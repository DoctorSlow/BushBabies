        <p>Bushbabies are a favorite food of chimps. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/4395-chimps-spears-hunt-bushbabies.html" target="_blank">Chimps fashion make-shift spears</a> out of sticks and use them 
            to stab into holes in trees where bushbabies may be sleeping or resting. After each plunge of the spear they smell or taste the tip to see if they hit a bushbaby treasure.</p>
        <p>Besides serving as yummy snacks for hungry chimps, bushbabies are also incredibly cute.</p>
        <p>See below for an adorable pic of a bushbaby not being eaten by a chimp.</p>
